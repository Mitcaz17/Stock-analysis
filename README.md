# Refactoring assignment

### Overview of Project:
The purpose of this assignment is to develop skills in refactoring code. Code refactoring is the process of changing an already made code to make it more efficientâ€”by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. In this analysis, we took daily ticker data for 12 stocks for 2 years in an MS Excel spreadsheet. Using scripting in visual basic (VB) we modified the Module 2 script to run in a more automated fashion so as to reduce code complexity, improve run times and make the code cleaner.

### Results

#### Stock performance
As we see all the stocks (except TERP) gave positive returns. The highest returns was obtained from DQ (=199.4%) and lowest from TERP (=7.2%). FSLR traded roughly 68 billion shares during 2017, whereas DQ traded just 3 billion shares.

 For the 2018 stock we also are able to see clear data. The highest returns was obtained from RUN (=84.0%) and lowest from DQ (=62.6%). ENPH traded roughly 60 billion shares during 2018, whereas AY traded just 8 billion shares.


#### Code execution times
The original solution took 0.4336 and 0.4297 seconds (rounded off to 4 decimal places) to run for 2017 and 2018, respectively. The refactored solution completed within 0.0664 and 0.0703 seconds (rounded off to 4 decimal places) for 2017 and 2018, respectively. This is **6 times speed-up**. If we had more data, the time speed-up would be more appreciable. This was possible due to use of arrays and loops. The execution time comparison is pictorial represented below.


### Summary
The code did a quick analysis of ticker data for 12 stocks for 2 years. The refactoring helped improve the execution time by manifolds. Next we discuss the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code; and finally how these apply to refactoring the original VBA script.

#### Advantages
By refactoring an existing code base we improve several aspects of the program, some of which are listed below:

1. Improves the design, structure, and/or implementation of the software
2. Improves code readability
3. Reduces code complexity
4. Improves source code's maintainability
5. Creates a cleaner internal architecture to improve extensibility
6. Improves performance

#### Disadvantages
Refactoring has some disadvantages too. Some of them are listed below:

1. Loss of accurate knowledge of the system
2. Lot of additional effort 
3. Generates architectural modifications that may damage the system
4. Trade-off between memory and speed

In the current example, the summarized datasets were stored in arrays. These arrays occupy memory. In low memory systems, this kind of refactoring may not improve performance. 

Overall, code refactoring is an important exercise to improve the updatability and maintainability of any software system.
